    <h3>Path Story
    </h3>
    <p>
        It all started with a letter written by Claire and Rev. Charles Orr, calling for the community to address the ever-increasing issue of homelessness. In response, on the night of December 8, 1983, 60 people gathered together to figure out how to help people who were experiencing homelessness in their neighborhoods. On that night, PATH was born.
The group started by distributing food and clothing to people living on the streets. As homelessness continued to grow nationwide, research revealed that Housing Firstâ€”a best practice model that first connects people to permanent housing and then focuses on stabilization through voluntary supportive services, proved more effective. Now, over thirty years later, we  provide services in more than 140 cities in six regions, and have more than 1,500 units of permanent supportive housing completed or in the pipeline.
Across the state, we help people find permanent housing and provide case management, medical and mental healthcare, benefits advocacy, employment training, and other services to help them maintain their homes stably. Since 2013, we have connected more than 9,000 people to permanent homes.
